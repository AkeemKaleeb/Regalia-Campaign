# Strong Start

As the first rays of dawn filter through the cracks in the wooden shutters of the small, yet surprisingly lavish guest quarters, the sounds of the bustling city of [[Yhiridil]] begin to stir beyond the manor walls. Birds call out to one another, and the faint clatter of early morning carts rolling over cobbled streets echoes in the distance. A soft knock at the door rouses you from your slumber. It's one of the servants, offering a warm breakfast and a message: the owner of the manor requests your presence in his study.

When you enter [[Ansel]]’s study, you find him gazing out of a grand window that overlooks the misty hills in the distance. His shoulders are tense, and there’s a deep sadness in his eyes that wasn’t there the night before. He turns to face you, and with a sigh, speaks.

_"I owe you all an apology."_ His voice is quiet but sincere. _"I misled you about my means. I... I have wealth, yes, but it is all being saved for a purpose. My eldest son, [[Aldric]], is due to depart for the holy site of [[Swordfall]] soon and meet with [[Relmar the Great]]. I have held onto every coin I can for his journey."_ He pauses, looking troubled. _"I had intended for him to leave weeks ago, but the roads have grown dangerous. Citizens heading to [[Swordfall]] are vanishing—more and more with each passing week. I fear for his safety."_

[[Ansel]] steps toward you, his eyes pleading now. _"I know I have no right to ask for your help after deceiving you, but I would gladly pay what I owe you, and more, if you would agree to escort Aldric to Swordfall. I cannot risk him traveling alone. There are rumors of dark forces at play, and… I fear the worst."_

As [[Ansel]] finishes, you catch a glimpse of a strange token hanging from his neck—a worn medallion, bearing the symbol of a sword crossed with a crescent moon. There’s something unsettling about it, but [[Ansel]] doesn’t seem to notice your gaze.

Before you can speak, a commotion erupts from outside. Through the window, you see a small group of villagers arguing with one of Ansel’s guards. Their voices carry through the air—_“More missing! The gods protect us!”_ They shout in desperation, pleading for help.

[[Ansel]]’s expression hardens. _"It’s getting worse. Please, I beg you—will you help us?"_

# Scenes

- (**DAY 1**) The journey to [[Swordfall]] is not an easy one, the path there diverging from the main road and winding its way through the hills and into the [[Tallspire Mountains]]. It will take three days to get to the [[Heartseeker Inn]], the midpoint between the main road and [[Swordfall]] itself, and the usual stopping point for travelers headed either way. From there, it'll be another three days to the holy site itself and the temple of [[Thuul]] that has made its home there.
- **Encounter**: [[Edward the Scout]], followed by Two [[Wolves]], One [[[Direwolf]]

**Reward**: 5 GP Each if helped

- (**DAY 2**) With the hunter's camp behind you, you continue your journey along the well-worn path to [[Swordfall]]. A few hours into daylight, you begin to hear the sound of rushing water somewhere ahead. Shortly thereafter, you come upon a large wooden bridge stretched across a chasm with a raging river below. As you get closer, you notice smoke rising from the bridge.
- **Encounter**: Noble [[Gregori]] and Commoners [[Alisha]] (Wife) and [[Carla]] (Daughter) at 0 hit points surrounded by five [[Goblins]] and a [[Hobgoblin]]

**Reward**: 10 GP each if healed

- (**DAY 3**) With the goblins dealt with, you continue along the path as it twists and turns, winding deeper into the mountainside. Eventually, after a full day on the road, your feet tired and sore, you crest a hill to find yourself standing before a small valley. At the center of this dip in the landscape is a large wooden building with a red tiled roof and a large sign that bears the image of an arrow piercing a heart.

The [[Heartseeker Inn]] is a single story building made of wood in the local fashion. Red tiles cover the roof, and a large chimney can be seen on one side. The inn has the following features unless noted otherwise. 
**Ceilings**. The ceilings are made of wood and rise 10 ft. above the floor.

**Floors and Walls**. The floors are made of hardwood while the walls are painted wood.

**Doors**. The doors are made of solid oak with metal reinforcements. They're all unlocked unless otherwise stated.

**Lighting**. The inn is lit during the day by sunlight coming through the windows. At night, oil lanterns hang from the walls.
