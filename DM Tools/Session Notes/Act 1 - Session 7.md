## **Review**
Upon returning to **[[Yhiridil]]**, the party was welcomed by **[[Ansel]]**, who rewarded them with a **home by the city wall** and a generous sum of gold. However, their arrival was not without mystery, as you quickly noticed a **cloaked figure tailing them** through the city streets.

Following the figure led them to the **[[Temple of the Nereids]]**, where **[[Selene]] reunited with her childhood caretaker, [[Sister Mirabel]], and the eager [[Acolyte Leorin]]**. Seeking answers, both [[Selene]] and [[Mori]] stepped into the [[Sacred Pools of Reflection]], experiencing cryptic visions:

- **Selene** saw a **darkened chamber surrounded by bubbles of her past, with a shadowy figure looming over her family crest**.
- **Mori** witnessed **a town engulfed in flames, her patron God staring at her in disapproval, warning that she was not meant to be there**.

Taking a brief respite from their growing tensions, the party indulged in a **shopping spree**, which unexpectedly resulted in **purchasing two bears**‚Äîa rather unconventional addition to their ranks.

Refocusing on the mystery at hand, you **tracked down the cloaked figure**. Upon capture, he took a **cyanide pill** before revealing much, but not before you found a note ordering him to rendezvous at the **[[Tavern of Whispers]]** once [[Selene]] had been killed.

At the **[[Tavern of Whispers]]**, the party met **[[Marya the Whisper]]**, an enigmatic informant, and a **red-cloaked figure** who urged them to **attend the royal Gala that evening for their next assignment**.

At the **Gala**, while trying to find the princess, you encountered **[[Alluin]]**, the **young elf obsessed with the princess**. The party **confronted him**, leading to a **public humiliation** that resulted in his **arrest by the royal guards**. Despite failing to locate the princess, you returned home, knowing that greater political machinations were at play.

## **Session Opening: Shadows of Yhiridil**

---

**The city of [[Yhiridil]] awakens to the golden glow of dawn, its streets already stirring with activity. Merchants call out their wares, noble carriages rattle over cobblestone paths, and the scent of spiced bread and morning mist lingers in the air. But amid the city‚Äôs usual bustle, something feels... different.

We start with you all resting in your new home by the wall, granted to you by [[Ansel]]. But rest has been fleeting. The weight of last night‚Äôs **failed search for the princess**, the **interrogation at the [[Tavern of Whispers]]**, and the **public humiliation of [[Alluin]]** still linger in the air. The city is **alive with rumors**‚Äîwhispers of **rebels infiltrating the Gala**, of **a mysterious red-cloaked figure pulling the strings**, and of **[[King Darius]] tightening his grip on the capital.**

---

**Meanwhile, [[Selene]]‚Ä¶**

Even before the knock, [[Selene]], your **dreams had been restless**. The warm embrace of slumber had turned into something colder, something deeper. You had found yourself standing in a darkened street‚Äî**a street you know.** The scent of old wood and burning lantern oil filled the air. The **cobbled road before you shimmered like glass**, reflecting a man‚Äôs silhouette.

You flashback to your childhood, running through these same streets, playing games, your parents lovingly watching you from their terrace. As you flash forward, you look up and meet eyes with the silhouette. 

Your heart knew the figure before you.

A voice‚Äîlow, familiar, sharpened with longing‚Äîspoke softly through the mist:

**‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have left me.‚Äù**

Then, a flicker of movement. The figure turns, stepping deeper into the city, towards the castle district. 

[[Selene]], you wake abruptly, your skin damp with sweat, your heart pounding. And just before the image fades completely, you swears you can still hear him say‚Äî

**‚ÄúFind me.‚Äù**

---

As the rest of the party stirs awake, the morning light casts long shadows across the room. Then, a sound‚Äî

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

A **soft knock at the door**, deliberate and controlled. Whoever stands on the other side **isn‚Äôt some curious merchant or common visitor.**

The bears begin to stir a little bit but do nothing more than a few grunts and snarls before curling back to sleep.

Upon opening the door, you find a **hooded figure**, face partially hidden beneath a dark blue veil embroidered with **silver threads‚Äîa pattern eerily similar to the sigil of the royal family and that of the man you captured the day before.** A gloved hand extends a folded note, the parchment **marked with the sigil of the [[Whispering Court]].**

**"The princess walks among the people today. Watch her, but do not be watched."**

Before you can ask further, the messenger **disappears into the morning crowd**, leaving behind only the lingering scent of jasmine and ink.

---

**The city awaits. The princess moves through its streets, watched by unseen eyes. A ghost from the past calls to Selene, promising answers or a trap. And somewhere, hidden within the heart of Yhiridil, the King‚Äôs hand tightens its grasp.**

**What would you like to do?**

## **Session Outline: Whispers in the Capital**

With [[Princess Illustrous]] set to visit the city center for shopping, the party must carefully navigate [[Yhiridil]]‚Äôs bustling streets to **gain an audience with her**, all while evading the watchful eyes of the royal guard.

---

If **[[Selene]] follows the visions too far**, they may lead her **into the underground passageways beneath the castle**, where **darker forces are at play.**

---

- **A potential ally in [[Princess Illustrous]]**‚Äîor a **confirmed enemy** if they fail.
- **New political entanglements** if [[Prince Galemorn]] decides to interfere in [[Selene]]‚Äôs fate.
- **A harrowing revelation** about [[Selene]]‚Äôs past and her connection to the powers at play.

---
### **Secrets**

1. **The Princess‚Äôs True Intentions** ‚Äì While Illustrous appears to be a loyal daughter, small inconsistencies in her words and behavior hint that she may have her own **plans beyond King Darius‚Äôs rule**. She is carefully testing the waters, but if she suspects the players are enemies or liabilities, she may **turn them over to the guards instead of allying with them**.
2. **A Shadow Over the Throne** ‚Äì The power vacuum left by recent events has not gone unnoticed. A secret faction within the city‚Äîpossibly members of the **royal court, nobles, or even foreign spies**‚Äîis looking to **use the princess as a pawn** to overthrow King Darius. However, they may be just as dangerous as the king himself, seeking to **replace him with their own puppet rather than restore justice.**
3. **Selene‚Äôs Lover Was Spared‚ÄîAt a Cost** ‚Äì If Selene follows the visions of her past lover, she will discover that he **was not executed for their forbidden love as she believed**. Instead, he was taken by **King Darius‚Äôs agents and imprisoned**. Whether he still serves the king, has been broken by his captivity, or is being used as a lure for Selene remains unclear‚Äîbut someone wants her to find him.
