## Review Session

 
## Strong Start  
  
We begin with the party nearing the gates of [[Yhiridil]]. The golden spires of the capital shine under the midday sun, and a warm breeze carries the sounds of city life ahead. Travelers and merchants line the roads, offering congratulations as they pass, having heard rumors of the party’s survival in [[Swordfall]]'s brutal arena. However, despite the cheerful exterior, a sense of unease begins to creep in.

#### **Hook 1: A Strange Gift and a Lingering Presence**

As the group approaches the gates, a courier clad in pristine white robes intercepts them, holding a small wooden box embossed with the royal seal of [[Regalia]]. Inside lies the a letter from [[Ansel]] asking them to return to his home posthaste to discuss compensation and reward for clearing [[Swordfall]] of its cultist problem.

As you discuss the letter, one of you notices a cloaked figure lurking just outside the gate. This figure is different from the cultists you’ve encountered before—dressed in a fine cloak lined with silver, their posture exudes wealth and professionalism. The figure doesn’t seem to attack but lingers just within sight, following you as you enter the city.

## Scenes  

#### **Challenge 1: Following the Cloaked Figure**

The group’s exploration is interrupted as the cloaked figure reappears in the crowd, now watching them more intently. If they choose to follow:

- The figure leads them through Yhiridil’s winding streets, evading them with practiced skill. A successful skill challenge (Stealth vs. Perception or Insight) allows the party to corner the spy in a shadowy alley.
- The figure attempts to bribe their way out of the encounter. They claim to be working for a “noble employer” but won’t reveal who unless coerced (through persuasion, intimidation, or clever roleplay).

#### **Hook 2: A Generous Welcome**

Upon arriving at [[Ansel]]'s home, you are greeted by [[Ansel]], who has been eagerly awaiting their return. His demeanor is warm, his gratitude effusive, and he immediately invites you into his estate. Here, he reunites with his son, offers a lavish meal, and tells you:

> "I am truly appreciative of your servitude and loyalty during this time. Reuniting me with my family so frequently, it is truly a gift from the Gods that I met you all. In exchange for your service I would like to offer you my home by the wall. Its smaller than this estate of course, but I do believe it would be nice to have some place to stay while you are here in this city. In addition to this, I would like to provide you four with the 1000 gold as promised.

However, the party might pick up on subtle oddities:

- Despite his joy, [[Ansel]]’s demeanor feels overly rehearsed.
- When asked about his family, he deflects questions about his other missing children.

Ansel leaves the group with a warning:  
> "Before you go, just know that [[Yhiridil]] is a city of masks, and those who peer too deeply behind them often find themselves lost."

#### **Hook 3 & Challenge 2: Freedom to Explore**

With a hefty sum of gold from their recent exploits, the party has free rein to explore the city. Yhiridil offers a host of attractions:

1. **[[The Gilded Market]]**: A sprawling bazaar filled with merchants selling rare items, magical trinkets, and exotic wares. Roleplay opportunities abound as merchants haggle and try to upsell their wares.
2. **[[The Heroes' Forum]]**: A public square where adventurers tell tales, spar for coin, and display relics.
3. **[[The Whistling Flagon]]**: A lively tavern known for its bardic performances and gossip network, perfect for gathering information.
4. The [[Temple of the Nereids]]: 

#### **Selene’s Story Arc Kickoff**

As the party explores the city, a shadowy figure begins tailing [[Selene]]. She notices them when visiting the Temple or interacting with locals. The figure doesn’t engage but drops a small token (a brooch bearing her family’s crest, bloodstained).

#### **Objective 2**: Track the shadowy figure.

- This involves navigating [[Yhiridil]]’s underbelly, gathering information about the spy network, and unearthing connections to [[King Darius]]. The party will discover that this spy is working on orders from within the castle and may even be connected to the cult of Thull.
    - Initial clues include the brooch, reports of the spy’s appearance near noble estates, and a lead to the _Tavern of Whispers_—a hub for information brokers in the city.
  
#### **Location: The Temple of the Nereids**

**Description**: The temple, dedicated to Selene, goddess of the sea, is an architectural marvel in the heart of Yhiridil. Its domed roof is encrusted with pearls and sapphires, giving it a shimmering, oceanic effect. The interior is equally breathtaking:

- Pools of water mirror the constellations, enchanted to reflect the night sky at all times.
- Statues of nereids, crafted from translucent blue crystal, seem to hum with faint divine energy.
- Whispered prayers carry a melodic resonance, creating an air of tranquility.

**Important NPCs Here**:

1. **Sister Mirabel**:
    - A wise and compassionate priestess who raised Selene during her time in the sisterhood. Mirabel radiates calm authority and often speaks in metaphors tied to the sea.
    - She expresses joy upon seeing Selene but quickly grows curious about the bloodstained brooch if Selene shares it.
    - She hints that Amphitrite’s favor often requires trials of the heart and warns Selene to be wary of "tempests in familiar waters."
2. **Acolyte Leorin**:
    - A young, overeager priest who idolizes Selene’s past dedication. He volunteers to guide the party through the temple and offers insights into its history and rituals.
    - If Selene shows signs of distress, Leorin nervously suggests consulting the temple’s sacred pools for guidance.

---

#### **Scene: The Sacred Pools**

Selene is invited by Sister Mirabel to seek divine insight from the temple’s Sacred Pools of Reflection. These pools are enchanted to reveal visions tied to a seeker’s past, present, or future.

**Mechanics**:

- Selene (or any character who assists) must offer a personal sacrifice—a memory, an object of emotional value, or a fragment of their divine connection—to activate the pool.

**Possible Outcomes**:

1. **Visions of the Past**:
    - Selene sees fragments of her childhood and a shadowy figure looming over her family crest. The vision suggests betrayal but offers no clarity about the culprit.
    - A flickering image of a young girl—her sister, perhaps—reaches out to her before being pulled into darkness.
2. **Glimpses of the Present**:
    - A vision shows the bloodstained brooch being handed to a cloaked figure. The figure’s hand bears the insignia of a noble house connected to [[King Darius]].
3. **Prophecy of the Future**:
    - The pool reveals an impending confrontation: Selene stands in a dark chamber, wielding radiant light against shadowy cultists. At her side is someone who seems familiar, yet her identity remains unclear.

Sister Mirabel interprets the visions cryptically, cautioning Selene that she must "untangle the currents of her lineage" to find peace.

---

#### **Plot Hook: The Shadowy Figure Returns**

As the party leaves the temple, the shadowy figure from earlier reappears. This time, they are more brazen, leaving a trail of subtle clues leading the group to a hidden area in the city.

1. **Trail of Clues**:
    - A torn piece of fabric matching the figure’s cloak, bearing the Valois family crest discovered outside the temple.
    - A passerby mentions seeing someone matching the figure’s description heading toward the [[Tavern of Whispers]].

---

#### **Location: Tavern of Whispers**

**Description**: Nestled in the back alleys of Yhiridil, this dimly lit establishment is a hub for spies, informants, and those seeking answers. Its owner, **Marya the Whisper**, is a sharp-witted tiefling who trades information for coin or favors.

**Key Interactions**:

1. **Marya the Whisper**:
    
    - She offers information about the figure in exchange for a favor: retrieving a stolen ledger from a rival.
    - If persuaded, she reveals that the figure works for an influential noble house secretly funding the cult of Thull.
2. **Optional Combat/Skill Challenge**:
    
    - The party may confront the shadowy figure directly here, leading to either a fight or a tense negotiation.

---

#### **Selene’s Personal Arc Objectives**

1. **Unearth Family Secrets**:
    
    - Gather more information about the significance of her family crest and its connection to the cult.
    - Piece together clues from the brooch and visions to locate her lost sibling or relatives.
2. **Confront the Cult’s Influence in Yhiridil**:
    
    - Expose the noble house aiding the cult of Thull.
    - Strengthen her divine bond by reaffirming her commitment to her path or seeking closure from the temple.
## Fantastic Locations  
  
#### **Location 1: The Gates of Yhiridil**

- **Description**: As the party approaches the grand city of [[Yhiridil]], they see the golden gates shimmer in the morning sun. A line of travelers and merchants waits to enter the city, and the group’s return sparks whispers of their exploits in [[Swordfall]]. The guards, previously cold and aloof, seem more respectful after the party’s growing reputation.
#### **Location 2: Ansel’s Estate**

- **Description**: [[Ansel]]’s primary home is in the affluent district near the city center. He greets the party warmly and praises their heroism. His son is safely reunited with the family. Ansel rewards the group with a smaller, but still luxurious, home near the city walls.
#### **Location 3: The Temple of the Nereids**

- **Description**: A serene [[Temple of the Nereids|temple]] dedicated to Amphitrite, goddess of the sea. The temple's interior is filled with fountains and magical pools reflecting moonlight even during the day. Selene’s connection to her past deepens here.

The head of the city guard stationed at the gates. She is stern but fair, and her respect for the players is evident.

A high-ranking priestess of the temple who knows [[Selene Valois|Selene]] well. She shows both warmth and concern for Selene, subtly probing her intentions since her departure.
