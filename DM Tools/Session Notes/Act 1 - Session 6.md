## Review Session

 
## Strong Start  
  
We begin with the party nearing the gates of [[Yhiridil]]. The golden spires of the capital shine under the midday sun, and a warm breeze carries the sounds of city life ahead. Travelers and merchants line the roads, offering congratulations as they pass, having heard rumors of the party’s survival in [[Swordfall]]'s brutal arena. However, despite the cheerful exterior, a sense of unease begins to creep in.

#### **Hook 1: A Strange Gift and a Lingering Presence**

As the group approaches the gates, a courier clad in pristine white robes intercepts them, holding a small wooden box embossed with the royal seal of [[Regalia]]. Inside lies the a letter from [[Ansel]] asking them to return to his home posthaste to discuss compensation and reward for clearing [[Swordfall]] of its cultist problem.

As you discuss the letter, one of you notices a cloaked figure lurking just outside the gate. This figure is different from the cultists you’ve encountered before—dressed in a fine cloak lined with silver, their posture exudes wealth and professionalism. The figure doesn’t seem to attack but lingers just within sight, following you as you enter the city.

## Scenes  

#### **Challenge 1: Following the Cloaked Figure**

The group’s exploration is interrupted as the cloaked figure reappears in the crowd, now watching them more intently. If they choose to follow:

- The figure leads them through Yhiridil’s winding streets, evading them with practiced skill. A successful skill challenge (Stealth vs. Perception or Insight) allows the party to corner the spy in a shadowy alley.
- The figure attempts to bribe their way out of the encounter. They claim to be working for a “noble employer” but won’t reveal who unless coerced (through persuasion, intimidation, or clever roleplay).

#### **Hook 2: A Generous Welcome**

Upon arriving at [[Ansel]]'s home, you are greeted by [[Ansel]], who has been eagerly awaiting their return. His demeanor is warm, his gratitude effusive, and he immediately invites you into his estate. Here, he reunites with his son, offers a lavish meal, and tells you:

> "I am truly appreciative of your servitude and loyalty during this time. Reuniting me with my family so frequently, it is truly a gift from the Gods that I met you all. In exchange for your service I would like to offer you my home by the wall. Its smaller than this estate of course, but I do believe it would be nice to have some place to stay while you are here in this city. In addition to this, I would like to provide you four with the 1000 gold as promised.

However, the party might pick up on subtle oddities:

- Despite his joy, [[Ansel]]’s demeanor feels overly rehearsed.
- When asked about his family, he deflects questions about his other missing children.

Ansel leaves the group with a warning:  
> "Before you go, just know that [[Yhiridil]] is a city of masks, and those who peer too deeply behind them often find themselves lost."

#### **Hook 3 & Challenge 2: Freedom to Explore**

With a hefty sum of gold from their recent exploits, the party has free rein to explore the city. Yhiridil offers a host of attractions:

1. **[[The Gilded Market]]**: A sprawling bazaar filled with merchants selling rare items, magical trinkets, and exotic wares. Roleplay opportunities abound as merchants haggle and try to upsell their wares.
2. **[[The Heroes' Forum]]**: A public square where adventurers tell tales, spar for coin, and display relics.
3. **[[The Whistling Flagon]]**: A lively tavern known for its bardic performances and gossip network, perfect for gathering information.
4. The [[Temple of the Nereids]]: 

#### **Selene’s Story Arc Kickoff**

As the party explores the city, a shadowy figure begins tailing [[Selene]]. She notices them when visiting the Temple or interacting with locals. The figure doesn’t engage but drops a small token (a brooch bearing her family’s crest, bloodstained).

#### **Objective 2**: Track the shadowy figure.

- This involves navigating [[Yhiridil]]’s underbelly, gathering information about the spy network, and unearthing connections to [[King Darius]]. The party will discover that this spy is working on orders from within the castle and may even be connected to the cult of Thull.
    - Initial clues include the brooch, reports of the spy’s appearance near noble estates, and a lead to the _Tavern of Whispers_—a hub for information brokers in the city.
